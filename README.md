# Task 5 – Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Objective
Learn and implement tree-based models for classification using the Heart Disease dataset.

## Dataset
Heart Disease Dataset  
Target:
- 0 = No Heart Disease  
- 1 = Heart Disease  

## Implementation
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
- Visualized the tree structure
- Controlled overfitting using max_depth
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Compared model accuracies
- Evaluated performance using 5-Fold Cross Validation
- Analyzed Feature Importances

## Tools
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Outcome
Random Forest achieved better generalization compared to a single Decision Tree.
